# `ti_tools`

`ti_tools` is a Rust crate for working with data used on TI-83/84 series calculators. Eventual goals for this crate include:

* A TI-Basic compiler and optimizer
* Ability to interface with TI calculators through a link cable
* Tools for working with Z80 assembly applications

For now I am working on developing simple tools to manipulate data that can be imported from or exported to Wabbitemu, a TI-84 Plus emulator. This project grows as my knowledge of the ins and outs of the calculator grows, and this is meant to be a fun side project before something practical.
